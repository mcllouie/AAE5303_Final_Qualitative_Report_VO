## 3. Project Snapshot

### 3.1 Project goal
To complete the 3 pipelines using the AMtown02 dataset, with the below challenges:
1.  Stubborn guy on using ARM Mac (i.e. no bootcamp) for completing visual SLAM.
2.  TAs had shut down the server **JUST BEFORE REPORT DATE** without prior notification, that computing 3DGS with notebook computers is an issue.
3.  U-Net have given a complete guide, but without hands-on.

Anyways, we successfully completed.

### 3.2 Pipeline overview
Since the dataset (AMtown02) was given by HKU MaRS Lab, we are able to perform 3 pipelines at the same time.
[3-5 sentences. Briefly explain the overall pipeline involving VO / 3D reconstruction / segmentation.]

### 3.3 My position in the pipeline
My position is Visual SLAM.
[3-5 sentences. Explain where your own work sat in the larger system.]

### 3.4 Reproducibility snapshot

[Describe what you personally configured, ran, organized, or improved.]

### Evidence
- Environment / container / setup command:
- Repo path / script:
- Screenshot / figure:
- Commit / issue / note:
- Reproducibility detail:

### What this shows
[Explain what the evidence shows about your readiness and workflow maturity.]

## 6. Indicator 2 - Prompting Strategy & AI Co-Creation

**Before-course confidence (optional):** `__/5`  
**End-of-course confidence:** `__/5`

### Situation / task
[What AI-assisted task is this section about?]

### What I did
[Describe one prompt that failed or was weak, and how you refined it.]

### Evidence
- Initial prompt:
- Revised prompt:
- Added context / file references:
- Resulting config or code change:
- What the AI still could not solve:

## 12. GenAI Use Declaration

During this course, I used the following AI tools: Google Ai Reply and Gemini.  
They were used for [environment setup / debugging / prompt-based code assistance / ~~language polishing / translation / none~~].  
All AI-assisted outputs included in this report were checked by me and verified against project requirements, documentation, or experimental evidence before being included.
